This project consists of the four major files named as: App.js, app.json, package-lock.json, package.json
# App.js

The primary part of the React Native application is contained in this file. It outlines the user interface's composition and capabilities. This is how the code is broken down:
- Component for navigation buttons: A reusable component that generates navigation buttons for the app's various sections.
- App component: The primary part responsible for managing the logic and state of the application.
- State variables for controlling user data, modal visibility, vehicle selection, registration, and authentication.
- Data sample for automobiles and repairs.
- Features that manage user registration, login, vehicle selection, and navigation.
- Rendering of different parts and components according to the user's level of authentication.
- Components such as the dashboard, AR overlay, car list, vehicle history, and login/registration forms.
- Styles: An object holding styles for various parts and components within the application.

# app.json
app.json

This file is an Expo project configuration file. It includes the application's settings and metadata, including:

- name: The application's name.
- slug: An application's special identification.
- version: The application's most recent iteration.
- orientation: The application's orientation (landscape or portrait).

Bundling patterns for assets are called assetBundlePatterns.
- iOS and Android: Device configuration parameters unique to each platform for iOS and Android.
- web: Web build configuration parameters.
Expo uses this file to set up the program and how it behaves across various platforms.

 # package.json

This file, which contains dependencies and metadata for the Auto Buddy program, is a configuration file for the Node.js project. What's in it is as follows:

name: The project's name ("autobuddy").

version: The project's 1.0.0 version as of right now.

main: Node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js, the application's entry point.

scripts: Scripts that are defined to run the program in various settings

start: Launches the development server for Expo.

android: Launches the application on an Android emulator or device and launches the Expo development server.

ios: Launches the application on an iOS simulator or device and launches the Expo development server.


web: Launches the application in a web browser and launches the Expo development server.

dependencies: Provides a list of the project's necessary dependencies.

Expo: The Expo SDK, which gives users access to a range of native services and APIs.

Expo-status-bar: A module designed to manage the Expo applications' status bar.

react: The user interface construction library React.

React Native may be used to create native mobile applications with the react-native library.

devDependencies: Enumerates the project's development dependencies.

JavaScript code can be transpiled using the @babel/core compiler core.

private: A signal that this package is private and shouldn't be added to a public registry.

The project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata must all be managed by this file in order for the program to be properly created, launched, and operated across several platforms.

# package-lock.json:

The dependencies and versions of the project are listed in this file, which is necessary for the project to function properly.
